    Learning SASS from scratch with The net.ninja
*****************************************************

Introduction:
- SASS is an extension to CSS that can help us write more fexible style
- Use variable, functions, conditional statements and more.
- split our SASS files up into modules, making it easier to keep on top of CSS for large project.
- SASS is written in RUBY

NB: The browser will not understand our SASS code, therefore we need to translate it into CSS code.

What we should know first?
- SASS looks similar with a programming language, so we should be comfortable with those progrmming fundamentals
  such as functions, variables, condition,... 
- CSS

Installing and compiling SASS:
- There are 2 ways to install SASS on our computer:
  First of all, by using command line but for that we need to install Rubi first because it is writting with it.
  And then by using a stand alone application.
  Here is the link https://sass-lang.com/install

  All steps by using command line:
  - install Rubi (https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
  - add this path: source\Ruby31-x64\bin it on path variable.
  - install sass 
    > gem install sass
    > sass -v (to check if sass is installed)

What is SASS?
- SASS is a CSS extension language, and gives our CSS superpower.
- SASS is an easiest way for developper to write CSS but we need to translate it to CSS code so that the browser can 
understand the code.

There are two syntax to write SASS code:

example:
  .sass (don't need brackets)
  
  $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif
  $primary-color: #333

  body
    font: 100% $font-stack
    color: $primary-color


  .scss

  $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  $primary-color: #333;

  body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
  }

  .css
  body {
    font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
  }

How to compile SASS?
With visual studio, we can use live compiler sass extension.
After installing it, set your json setting (visual studio setting).

- The map css file tell us about the location of sass file.

SASS Partials:
Allows us to split up our code into multiple styles, to keep more organize our code.
This allows us to modularize our CSS code and allows us for better structure of our 
stylesheet.
A partial is a sass file named with a leading underscore, i.e _partial.scss.

The underscore lets sass know that the specific file is a partial and will not generate
into a css file.

Avantages:
- easy to debug
- allows us to works with others developpers in the same time

1- Getting start with SASS code: 
@forward rules
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward

The rule is written @forward "<url>". It loads the module at the given URL just like @use,
but it makes the public members of the loaded module available to users of your module as though they were defined directly in your module

Variables:
We use variables to refers things like font-size, color, spacing and so on...

https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables

SASS variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with $, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself.
But despite their simplicity, they're one of the most useful tools Sass brings to the table.

Pros: (Avantages)
Variables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, and much more.

Syntax:
<variable>: <expression>

Example:
$font-size: 12px;


/* Remind */
The root selector: 
The :root selector allows you to target the highest-level “parent” element in the DOM, or document tree.

@use rules:
The @use rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. 
Stylesheets loaded by @use are called "modules".

The simplest @use rule is written @use "<url>", which loads the module at the given URL.
